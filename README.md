# Web_Automation_using_UiPath-Laptop_Data
It is a bot which will go search for laptop on a online shopping site and scrap the relevant information.

This is an another RPA project of Web Automation using UiPath Studio.
In this automation, the bot will go search for laptop on flipkart.com and scrap all the relevant information about the product like it's name, configuration, rating and it's price. Then all the scrapped data will be stored in a variable and then the bot will pass the variable into a new excel spreadsheet to store the data of laptop.

Hoping you'll like it.
Thank You !!
